This is a Photo Gallery project with the help of Flickrs API, a developed client application using html,css and vanilla Javascript which lets you search and browse through thousands of images.

A web app built on Flickr's API where you can:
* Search for images using text search
* Display the search result in a nice way in gallery form
* Present a image using the lightbox effect
* Functionality that sorts image by relevancy, by date ascending and descending order, with tags or no tags and how many images to display on the page at one time
